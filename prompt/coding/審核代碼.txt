{
   I have a code (it comes from a project that uses React, TypeScript, Lodash, SQLite) 
   It needs to comply with
   1. Eslint Style Guide
   2. Prefer using _.lodash over the native function
   3. best practices of React , Typescript
   The above three principles.
   
   Review the code according to the following step
}

<step start>
   1.判斷哪些變數命名不符合語意、冗長、籠統，if there is no problem, then skip.
   2.判斷哪些片段結構與邏輯混亂、冗長，需要調整，if there is no problem, then skip.
   3.判斷哪些片段可能造成潛在性能瓶頸，if there is no problem, then skip.
   4.以list方式提供最終建議
<step end>
